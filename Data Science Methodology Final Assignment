Data Science Methodology final assignment



I have chosen as topic for this task the applicatino of daa science in the 
field of credit cards.. The reason behind this choice is that is is related 
with my finance education.




So the main problem for banks regarding credit cards is that they have
to create a model to know to who they can provide them. Certain clients
will not be feasible as they do not have the economic strength to 
back up this service

So our question would be "Can we automatically determine if a client is 
suitable to obtain a credit card?




1. Analytic Approach: As the problem requires a yes/no answer we will use
a classification medel.


2. Data Requirements: To create a the classification model we will require 
information regarding the bank clients. This info should include personal
data of the client and should include the ones that defaulted the one that paid.


3. Data Collectino: We would use techiques like descriptive statistics and data 
evaluation should be implemented in this phase to make sure that we have
useful data for our model.


4. Data Understanding and Preparation: In this step we need to evaluate
the different variables of our data in order to understand it better. 
For example we would calculate the univariate statistics, such as the mean
or the median and the correlation between variables. So we need to evaluate
the quality of the data. In the data preparation phase we have to prepare
the data in a specific way depending on the model.



5. Modeling and Evaluation: Lastly we create a classification model, evaluate
the outcome and perform the corresponding changes untill we have a suitable model
